* **CPU.java** - Representation of CPU and instructions implemented.
* **Memory.java** - Representation of memory utilized when executing a program (a secondary process invoked from CPU process).
* **Sample1.txt** - Tests the indexed load instructions. Prints two tables, one of A-Z, the other of 1-10.
* **Sample2.txt** - Tests the call/ret instructions. Prints a face where the lines are printed using subroutine calls.
* **Sample3.txt** - Tests the int/iret instructions. The main loop is printing the letter A followed by a number that is being periodically incremented by the timer. The number will increment faster if the timer period is shorter.
* **Sample4.txt** - Tests the proper operation of the user stack and system stack, and also tests that accessing system memory in user mode gives an error and exits.
