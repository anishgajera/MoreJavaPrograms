# Linked-List-Cross-Reference
Linked List Cross Reference. Usage of linked list to separate any text document word-by-word and show each word's frequency and which lines it appears on.
# Summary
This program uses a linked list to take a file, read its contents, separate each word in the file and output it, its frequency (how many times the word is repeated), and on which lines the repetitions occur on. Also displayed is the total number of words in the file and the total number of unique words (non-repeated).
User is asked to enter a file name; once a valid filename is entered, the program will use a series of linked list methods and nodes to separate the list and output the correct output.
