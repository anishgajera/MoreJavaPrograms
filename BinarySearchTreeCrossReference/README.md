# Binary-Search-Tree-Cross-Reference
Binary Search Tree Cross-Reference. This program implements the use of Binary Search Tree(s) to parse through and separate any text file word-by-word and show each word's frequency and which lines it appears on.
# Summary
The program goes through a text file of any size, separates that file line-by-line and word-by-word, and outputs each individual word in alphabetical order, along with outputting its frequency and the line numbers the word is repeated on. Also displayed is the total number of words in the file and the total number of unique words (non-repeated). All the user needs to do is input the file name they would like to cross-reference and the program should do the rest.
